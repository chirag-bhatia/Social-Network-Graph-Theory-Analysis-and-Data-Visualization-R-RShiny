# Social-Network-Graph-Theory-Analysis-and-Data-Visualization-R-RShiny

• Investigated a network of emails to understand pairwise relations among a vast organizational network using R packages like igraph and networkD3
• Calculated centrality metrics like Indegree Centrality, Outdegree Centrality, Betweenness, and Closeness to understand the network flow among members as well as identify important nodes of the organization
• Computed and visualized the 2-hop neighbors of top 10 nodes among above centrality metrics
• Aggregated emails between individuals at department level to create and visualize a departmental network graph
• Created an RShiny front-end application to support this Graph Theory project
